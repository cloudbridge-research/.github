# CloudBridge Research Engineering Ethics Declaration

**CloudBridge Research** develops technologies that must remain resilient not only to technical failures, but also to human, political, and societal errors.  
We believe that an engineer’s role is not to serve authority or the market, but to build infrastructure that protects society in the long term.

Our principles are simple:

---

### **1. Transparency is more important than trust.**
Systems must be open to audit and externally verifiable.  
Security claims mean nothing without the ability to validate them.

### **2. Resilience is more important than strength.**
We design architectures that continue to function  
even when people make mistakes, devices fail,  
and external actors behave unpredictably.

### **3. Technology must protect the weak.**
If an architecture ignores the vulnerabilities of society,  
it will automatically empower the strong.

### **4. Freedom is the ability to choose.**
Users must have the right to decide  
who controls their data, traffic, and identity.

### **5. An engineer is accountable to the future.**
We build systems that will outlive political cycles,  
market trends, and the short-term interests of corporations.

These principles guide every decision at **CloudBridge Research** —  
from protocol development to the creation of global infrastructure.
